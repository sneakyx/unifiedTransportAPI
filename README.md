# UnifiedTransportAPI

The climate crisis requires a better use of existing resources. Not everyone should have to rely on owning their own vehicle, even in rural areas. Everyone should have the right to travel affordably and without complications to any destination at any time. Whether using their own vehicle or as a passenger, the choice should be theirs. Ideally, resources such as parking spaces, vehicles, and drivers should be used efficiently and according to demand, while taking into account personal preferences and physical abilities.

This project also aims to ensure that people with disabilities can enjoy comfortable and accessible transport options, just like those who prefer to drive themselves. The goal is to provide mobility that is inclusive and adaptable to the needs of everyone.

## Key Features

- **Unified API**: Access public transport, ride-sharing, and rental services through a single interface.
- **Fediverse-inspired Protocol**: Decentralized data exchange between different transport providers.
- **Multi-modal Journey Planning**: Easily combine different types of transport into one trip.
- **Integration with Vehicles**: Designed to be embedded in vehicles, with future support for autonomous vehicles.
- **Reduce Empty Trips**: Optimize transportation by minimizing empty trips and making better use of existing resources.
- **Broad App Integration**: Provides a versatile interface for apps and applications aiming to simplify transport.
- **Support for Bikes, Buses, Trains, and Taxis**: Future integration plans include support for bike rentals, buses, trains, taxis, and autonomous vehicles.

The goal of UnifiedTransportAPI is to make urban mobility more flexible, efficient, and accessible for everyone by connecting different transport options in a standardized way. It strives to reduce empty trips, improve resource usage, and offer a versatile interface for developers of transportation-related apps and services.

## Status of project

At the moment this project is only an idea. I have some Code examples in my head, but a lot of research has to be done before writing the first line of code.
